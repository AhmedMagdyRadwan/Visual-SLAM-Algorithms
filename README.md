# Visual-SLAM-Algorithms

This repository contains the codes used for applying the vSLAM algorithms to evaluate them and come up with the optimal one. which is the aim of my course work project for my master course subjects: System identification and simulation, Introduction to Intelligent Mobile Robots. 

The main goal of this project is to come up with the most optimal visual slam algorithm for example to generate trajectory for moving objects like cars, by applying different algorithms and comparing the results from each one.

Below are the links to the Repositories for the vSLAM packages that i used to evaluate the algorithms:
